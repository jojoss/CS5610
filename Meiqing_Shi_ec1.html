        <p></p>
        <p class="content">This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="content">Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>
        <p></p>
    
    <h2 class="content">Ingredients</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p class="content">1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans) 175g of tahini 6 sundried tomatoes Half a red pepper A pinch of cayenne pepper 1 clove of garlic A dash of olive oil.</p>
        <p></p>
    
    <h2 class="content">Instructions</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p class="content">Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely Add all the ingredients into a food processor Process all the ingredients into a paste If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="content">For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>
        <p></p>

    <h2 class="content">Storage</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p class="content">Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="content">Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
